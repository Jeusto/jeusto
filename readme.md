<p align="center"></p>

<p>I'm Arhun Saday, also known as Jeusto. I've been close to a computer since an early age and been passionate about it since then. <br/> </p>
<p>I've been doing graphic design and 3D modeling as a hobby for a few years. Fast forward to today, I study computer science and maths at the University of Strasbourg in France.</p>
<p>I do programming in various languages and technologies including Typescript, React, Nextjs, Python, Java and more. I try to learn and get better every single day. I especially love designing and building interesting & useful stuff with code.</p>

🚀 Exploring opportunities and side projects.

🏫 Currently a student at the University of Strasbourg in France.
