ðŸ‘‹ Hey! I'm Arhun Saday, also known as Jeusto. I've been close to a computer since an early age and been passionate about it ever since. I'm currently pursuing a Master's degree in Software Engineering through a work-study program while working as a software developer specializing in web and mobile development.

I do programming in various languages and technologies including Typescript, Go, Angular, React and much more. I'm passionate about software engineering, problem solving and I especially love creating all sorts of delightful products, interfaces, and interactions.

If you're interested, you can take a look at some of my <a href="https://jeusto.com/projects">personal projects</a> or read my <a href="https://jeusto.com/blog">blog</a>. If you have a question, or want to collaborate, feel free to <a href="mailto:arhunsad@gmail.com">email</a> me or contact me through one of the links above.
