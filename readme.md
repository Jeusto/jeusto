👋 Hey! I'm Arhun Saday, also known as Jeusto. I've been close to a computer since an early age and been passionate about it ever since. I've had graphic design and 3D modeling as a hobby for a few years. Fast forward to today, I study computer science and maths at the University of Strasbourg in France and I'm also a freelance full stack developer.
<br>
I do programming in various languages and technologies including Typescript, React, Python and much more. I'm passionate about software development, problem solving and I especially love creating all sorts of delightful products, interfaces, and interactions.

🚀 Exploring opportunities and side projects.
<br>
🏫 Currently a student at the University of Strasbourg in France.
